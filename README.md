## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/HassaneJaber/leo_chatbot.git
cd your-repo
2️⃣ Set Up Your Environment
Since the API key is hidden for security, you need to create a .env file.

Copy the example file:

cp .env.example .env
Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
3️⃣ Start Your Local Server (XAMPP)
Move the project folder to C:\xampp\htdocs\ai_app
Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP
Open http://localhost/ai_app/index.php in your browser
🔒 Security Notes
Never share your .env file publicly.
Ensure .gitignore includes .env before pushing to GitHub.
Use a rate-limited OpenAI API key if deploying publicly.
